## about me:
hi, my name is armaan bassi! I’m a sophomore studying computer science and electrical engineering at UCLA. I'm interested in software engineering, quantitative finance, robotics, and artificial intellegence. 

I was born and raised in north New Jersey. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music 🎶🎶, lifting weights 🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♂️, rock climbing (not beating the CS major stereotypes) 🧗🧗, playing video games 🎮🎮, and formula 1 (i'm a diehard mclaren fan) 🏎️🏎️
