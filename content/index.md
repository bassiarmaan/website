title: Hi, I'm Armaan!
---

I'm a sophomore at UCLA studying Computer Science and Engineering who enjoys solving problems at the intersection of AI, robotics, and software.

Currently I'm a Software Engineering Intern at Quanergy Solutions, a 3D LiDAR Security Company. At Quanergy, I am implementing and optimizing algorithms for real-time processing to enhance security surveillance capabilities. I am also developing documentation for software tools and workflows within the company.
